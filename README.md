# Abstract 
Min-max saddle point games appear in a wide range of applications in machine leaning and signal processing. Despite their wide applicability, theoretical studies are mostly limited to the special convex-concave structure. While some recent works generalized these results to special smooth non-convex cases, our understanding of nonsmooth scenarios is still limited. In this work, we study special form of non-smooth min-max games when the objective function is (strongly) convex with respect to one of the playerâ€™s decision variable. We show that a simple multi-step proximal gradient descent-ascent algorithm converges to $\epsilon$-first-order Nash equilibrium of the min-max game with the number of gradient evaluations being polynomial in 1/$\epsilon$. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through adversarial attack on a LASSO estimator.

# Summary of the proposed algorithm
The idea behind the proposed algorithm is that in each iteration, the maximization problem is solved to a good accuracy.This gives us an estimate of the gradient of the minimization problem. This gradient is later used for solving the outer minimization problem.

# Reuslts 
 We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for the problem of attacking the LASSO estimator.  
 In other words, our goal is to find a small perturbation of the observation matrix that worsens the performance of the LASSO estimator in the training set.
 Following figure shows the performance of the proposed algorithm.
